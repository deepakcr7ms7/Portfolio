                            <p>
                                I didn’t grow up planning to study abroad. The idea arrived quietly and stayed.
                                I wanted something harder. Something that would push me beyond what felt comfortable.
                                In a family where my siblings were accomplished doctors, I knew I had to carve my own space.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Engineering felt natural. I liked breaking things down, understanding how systems worked,
                                and building something from nothing. Still, the question followed me everywhere:
                                <em>Why not become a doctor?</em>
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                “Every time I answer that question, I pause. I’ve doubted it before — but this path felt honest.”
                            </blockquote>
                        </div>
                    </div>


                    <!-- STEP 2 -->
                    <div class="journey-step">
                        <div class="step-icon"><i class="fas fa-plane-arrival"></i></div>
                        <div>
                            <h3>Flight Toward the Dream</h3>
                            <p>
                                I started preparing in my third year. The exams themselves were manageable —
                                what I never anticipated was the emotional cost of staying committed to a goal
                                that looked different from everyone else’s.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During that time, campus placements were happening. Friends were interviewing,
                                getting offers, celebrating. While they were moving forward, I was choosing to wait.
                                That quiet discipline — staying focused amid all that noise — was harder than any exam.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I cleared the qualifying exams. Applications went out.
                                Rejections came first — then one day, an email arrived.
                                My first admit letter. I was sitting with friends when I saw it.
                                Everyone noticed. Everyone celebrated. For the first time, the dream felt real.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I thought the hard part was over. Then COVID hit.
                                My 2020 plans collapsed overnight. Everything was deferred.
                                The waiting stretched on — filled with uncertainty, paperwork, and anxiety.
                                Somewhere in that chaos, I injured my hand. Pain became background noise.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And then came the day I left home.
                                I still remember the faces. The silence. The weight of it all.
                                I had never flown before — not even once.
                                My first flight wasn’t for vacation — it was to the U.S. Embassy in Delhi.
                                That’s when it truly sank in: this was happening.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                “Three bags. Twenty-three years. One flight.”

                            <h3>New Country, New Pressure</h3>
                            <p>
                                The U.S. felt overwhelming at first. New food. New weather.
                                Speaking English all day took effort. I overloaded credits,
                                worked as a TA, and tried to save money wherever I could.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Everyone talked about internships. I didn’t get one.
                                Summer came — and I stayed back, alone in the dorms.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then came the final semester — and still no interviews.
                                I knew it was going to be a long battle.
                                I picked up a night shift job at the library so I could save money, attend classes during the day, and apply for jobs in between.

                            <p>
                                Graduation came with no job offer — only a ticking clock. I had 90 days.
                                When I narrowly missed a required grade in my ML specialization, I thought another door had closed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Instead, a professor offered me a Research Assistant role.
                                It didn’t solve everything — but it gave me what I needed most: time.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>

                            <p>
                                Money ran out. Rejections kept coming. I picked up my bike and went door to door — shop to shop — looking for part-time work. Nothing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then a break — my roommate’s old gas station job needed help. I said yes.
                                It was winter. No Uber. No buses. I biked two miles in the cold every day.
                                Stocked shelves. Cleaned floors. Took out trash. Just one more month — that was the goal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After that, I got a job at Subway. The owner was around my sister’s age.
                                She became like a big sister. One of the other workers — a funny Indian lady — made me laugh during shifts.
                                For the first time in a long while, I didn’t feel completely alone.

                            <p>
                                By now, it had been ten months since graduation — ten months of rejection emails, sleepless nights,
                                cold meals, cold rides, and learning to expect nothing... and still trying anyway.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then came October. A message popped up: interview opportunity. Broadridge. I didn’t react.
                                I’d learned not to. Just another chance — nothing more.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I squeezed in prep between Subway shifts. Still cooking all my meals. No Uber. No takeout. Just persistence — and a laptop that never went cold.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                First round: managerial. Calm. Focused. Curious. They liked me.
                                Second round: coding. I got stuck. My heart sank. But I locked in.
                                Not with fresh prep — but with the muscle memory of long, lonely nights.
                                I asked for a hint. I solved it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                An hour later, my phone rang.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>

                                I cried — not because of the job, but because of everything it took to get there.
                                Not quiet tears — but the kind that come when your body finally lets go.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From gas station floors. From taped fingers. From missed opportunities. From pride. From silence.
                                From stubborn hope.
